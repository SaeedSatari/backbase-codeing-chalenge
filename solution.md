This project created to solve https://www.backbase.com/ coding challenge.

## Solution

This application indicates whether a movie won a “Best Picture” Oscar, given a movie’s title based on OMDB API and the
existing CSV file. I provided 2 APIs for registration and login purpose. Also, there are 2 APIs which are related to
academy awards. One of them returns a list of academy awards based on OMDB API and the other one, shows if the given
movie title is the "Best Picture" winner or not. There are 2 APIs regarding Movies, first one is returning a list of top
ten movies based on box-office, and the second one is using for rating a movie.
